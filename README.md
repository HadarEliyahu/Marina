A personal assistant that runs on both Android and Windows systems.
The assistant can do simple requests like opening programs, search in the browser, turn off the device etc.

Another important feature of the assistant is to transfer requests from Windows to Android and vice versa by adding "on my phone/pc/computer" at the end of the request,
and also transfer text to clipboard on the other device.
The connection between devices is account based.
